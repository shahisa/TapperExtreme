# TapperExtreme
A Tapper Game for iOS. Worked by: Isaiah Weaver
#User Story
The user can enter in a number for how many times the user wants to tap to end the game. After the game ends it resets and starts over. 
# Additions
Will add button for quiting the game during gameplay.

#Challenges
The decimal keyboard will not dissapear after touching the screen. The onTap function will not work. Additionally, the game will not end/ restart after tapping the coin the set number of times. I fixed the problem by overriding the function and it turned out my bool values were reversed thats why the game never restarted.
